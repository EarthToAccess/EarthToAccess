I am EarthToAccess, a 20 year old guy who enjoys coding and programming. Currently, there are no repositories or projects you can find here, as I am primarily using this account for collaborations and grabbing repositories my own self!

---

### Do you plan on making any public projects in the future?

Maybe! I'm still getting the hang of using GitHub effectively, but once I figure it out near-fully I'll likely use it for whatever projects I deem allowed to be available for public use! It'll mostly be pet projects though, so don't expect anything big.

### What's the point of having an account with no repositories or forks?!

As I said before, this account is used in collaborations and pulling of other repositories for team projects, as well as issue tracking and reporting on others' repositories or issue trackers I use (e.g. GIMP's issue tracker, a few plug-ins for Minecraft are hosted here, etc. etc.). It was never really meant to be a place to showcase my own stuff, and in the event this section is deemed obsolete, you'll know I had a change of heart! For now, though, don't expect much.

### What's with all the linked badges up there?

I do a lot more that just programming and coding.

- On my YouTube and SoundCloud, I make music (though I'm *much* more active on my SoundCloud).
- On my Twitter... I'm not actually that active on there, come to think of it. But occasionally when I am it's for updates about my variety of stuff I make.
- On my Reddit, I just bullshit really. I comment, I jest, I scream at low-effort spammers. Yknow, the whole nine yards.
- On my Twitch, I decide every once in a blue moon to stream. Otherwise, you might catch me in some chats.
